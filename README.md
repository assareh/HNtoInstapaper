"Hacker News is a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship." 

The @newsyc100 Twitter account tweets links posted to Hacker News that have earned 100 or more points.

I like reading The New Yorker and The Atlantic, but this script can be used for any websites. This script checks the last 200 tweets from the @newsyc100 Twitter account, looks for links to New Yorker and Atlantic articles, and then sends any results to your Instapaper account.

To use, populate your Twitter API credentials and Instapaper account credentials. 
Edit the TARGET_URLS list to include your desired websites (nytimes.com, medium.com, etc).
